## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

ANOMALLY DETECTION
```{r}
df3 <- read.csv('http://bit.ly/CarreFourSalesDataset')
df3

```

```{r}
head(df3)
```

```{r}
install.packages("magrittr") # package installations are only needed the first time you use it
install.packages("dplyr")    # alternative installation of the %>%
library(magrittr) # needs to be run every time you start R and want to use %>%
library(dplyr)   
```
```{r}
library(tibbletime)

```

 
```{r}
Adf3 <- df3 %>% group_by(Date) %>%
mutate(Date = as.Date (Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")) %>% as_tbl_time(index = Date)

```

```{r}
head(Adf3)

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(anomalize)
library(tibble)
```

```{r}
tidyverse_cran_downloads

```

```{r}
# performing anomaly detection on the sales 
Adf3_anomalized <- Adf3 %>% summarise(Orders = sum(Sales)) %>%
    time_decompose(Orders) %>%
    anomalize(remainder, alpha = 0.25, max_anoms = 0.2) %>%
    time_recompose() %>%
    plot_anomalies(time_recomposed = TRUE) +
    ggtitle("alpha = 0.25, max_anoms = 0.2")
```


I couldnâ€™t find any anomalies with the normal Alpha of 0.05, but when I increased it to 0.25, I found some probable anomalies.

CONCLUSION
The months of February and March saw the most anomalies.
The month of January had the fewest anomalies.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The management should check into the sales that occur in February and March because there is a risk of either losses or unexplained earnings pilfering.
A system that detects anomalies as soon as they occur should also be in place so that they can be explored as quickly as feasible.
